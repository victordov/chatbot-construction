# Activity Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of activity tracking in the task management system with company-scoped visibility.

## Issues Fixed (June 26, 2025)

### Problem: Activity tracking not working for super admin users
**Root Cause**: Super admin users don't have a company assigned, but the Activity and Task models required a company field, causing validation errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Modified Activity Model** (`models/activity.js`):
   - Made `company` field optional (`required: false, default: null`)
   - Allows activities to be logged for super admin users without a company

2. **Modified Task Model** (`models/task.js`):
   - Made `company` field optional (`required: false, default: null`)
   - Allows tasks to be created by super admin users without a company

3. **Updated Activity Service** (`services/activity.js`):
   - All activity logging methods now handle null company values
   - Super admin users can log activities with `company: null`
   - Updated `getTaskActivities()` to handle super admin access (can see all activities)

4. **Updated Task Service** (`services/task.js`):
   - Updated all methods to accept user role parameter
   - Super admin users can access all tasks regardless of company
   - Modified query logic to skip company filtering for super admin users

5. **Updated Task Routes** (`routes/task.js`):
   - Pass user role to service methods
   - Super admin users have unrestricted access to all tasks and activities

6. **Updated Frontend** (`public/js/admin_parts/admin-tasks.js`):
   - Added activity reloading after task updates via modal

### Key Changes Made:
- **Company field made optional** in both Activity and Task models for super admin support
- **Role-based access control** implemented throughout the system
- **Super admin users** can now create/update tasks and log activities without company restrictions
- **Activity tracking** now works for all user roles including super admin

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Backend Models and Services

#### Activity Model (`models/activity.js`)
- **Purpose**: Track all task-related activities
- **Key Features**:
  - Company-scoped activities (users can only see activities from their company)
  - Comprehensive activity types (created, updated, commented, etc.)
  - User and task references with population
  - Indexed by task, company, and timestamp for performance

#### Activity Service (`services/activity.js`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized service for logging and retrieving activities
- **Key Methods**:
  - `logActivity()`: Generic activity logging
  - `logTaskCreated()`: Specialized for task creation
  - `logTaskUpdated()`: Specialized for task updates with field-specific messages
  - `logTaskCommented()`: Specialized for comments
  - `getTaskActivities()`: Retrieve activities for a task (company-filtered)

#### Updated Task Model (`models/task.js`)
- **Changes**: Added `company` field with index for multi-tenancy
- **Purpose**: Ensure tasks are scoped to companies

#### Updated Task Service (`services/task.js`)
- **Changes**:
  - All task queries now filter by company
  - Activity logging integrated into all major operations:
    - Task creation
    - Task updates (status, priority, due date, assignment changes)
    - Task deletion
    - Follow-up task creation
  - Company inheritance for follow-up tasks

#### Updated Comment Service (`services/comment.js`)
- **Changes**: Added activity logging when comments are added

### 2. Backend Routes

#### Task Routes (`routes/task.js`)
- **Updates**:
  - All endpoints enforce company scoping
  - User context passed to services for activity logging
  - New endpoint: `GET /api/tasks/:id/activities`
  - Task deletion now logs activities before deletion

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Admin Tasks UI (`public/js/admin_parts/admin-tasks.js`)
- **New Features**:
  - Activity loading and display in task details window
  - Real-time activity updates after task changes and comments
  - Icon-based activity visualization
  - Timestamp formatting

### 4. Database Migration

#### Migration Script (`migrate-tasks-company.js`)
- **Purpose**: Backfill company field for existing tasks
- **Process**: Associates tasks with their creator's company
- **Usage**: Run with `node migrate-tasks-company.js`

## Activity Types Tracked

1. **Task Creation**: When a new task is created
2. **Task Updates**: When task fields are modified (status, priority, due date, assignment)
3. **Comments**: When comments are added to tasks
4. **Task Deletion**: When tasks are deleted
5. **Follow-up Tasks**: When follow-up tasks are created

## Company Scoping

### Backend
- All task and activity queries filter by user's company
- Tasks inherit company from their creator
- Follow-up tasks inherit company from parent task
- Activities are only visible to users within the same company

### Frontend
- Task details window loads activities via company-filtered API
- Activities automatically reload after relevant actions

## Key Security Features

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Complete isolation between companies
2. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid authentication
3. **Authorization**: Operator role required for task management
4. **Data Isolation**: Users can only see tasks and activities from their company

## API Endpoints

### New/Updated Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` - Lists tasks (company-filtered)
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get task details (company-filtered)
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create task (with activity logging)
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task (with activity logging)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task (with activity logging)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/follow-up` - Create follow-up task (with activity logging)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/comments` - Add comment (with activity logging)
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/activities` - **NEW**: Get task activities

## Database Schema Changes

### Tasks Collection
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  company: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Company', required: true, index: true }
}
```

### Activities Collection
```javascript
{
  taskId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Task', required: true, index: true },
  userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  company: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Company', required: true, index: true },
  action: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  details: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now, index: true }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create tasks** and verify activities are logged
2. **Update tasks** (status, priority, due date, assignment) and check activity feed
3. **Add comments** and verify comment activities appear
4. **Create follow-up tasks** and ensure they inherit company and log activities
5. **Delete tasks** and verify deletion is logged
6. **Test company isolation** by creating tasks/activities with different companies
7. **Run migration script** on existing data

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Backup database** before deployment
2. **Deploy new code** with activity tracking
3. **Run migration script**: `node migrate-tasks-company.js`
4. **Verify company scoping** is working correctly
5. **Test activity tracking** in all workflows

## Performance Considerations

- Activities collection is indexed by `taskId`, `company`, and `createdAt`
- Tasks collection has `company` index for efficient filtering
- Activity queries are limited and paginated in the service layer
- Company filtering happens at the database level for optimal performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Activity Pagination**: Implement pagination for tasks with many activities
2. **Activity Types**: Add more granular activity types (field-specific changes)
3. **Activity Notifications**: Real-time notifications for activity updates
4. **Activity Export**: Allow exporting activity logs for reporting
5. **Activity Search**: Search through activity descriptions and details

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `models/activity.js`
- `services/activity.js`
- `migrate-tasks-company.js`
- `ACTIVITY_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `models/task.js` (added company field)
- `services/task.js` (activity logging, company filtering)
- `services/comment.js` (activity logging)
- `routes/task.js` (company scoping, activity endpoints)
- `public/js/admin_parts/admin-tasks.js` (activity display)

## Issues Identified and Fixed (June 26, 2025)

### Problem
Activity tracking was not working for super admin users when changing task details because:

1. **Company field requirement**: Both Task and Activity models required a `company` field, but super admin users don't have a company assigned
2. **Missing user role context**: The activity service wasn't receiving the user role to properly handle super admin users
3. **Database validation errors**: Creating tasks and activities failed validation due to missing company field

### Root Cause Analysis
From the application logs, the following errors were identified:
```json
{
  "error": "Activity validation failed: company: Path `company` is required.",
  "company": null,
  "user": "684462730d12a77155d3c2e5",
  "userName": "admin"
}
```

The super admin user (`admin@chatbot.com`) has `role: "superadmin"` but no `company` field, which is correct according to the User model design.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Model Updates
- **Task Model** (`models/task.js`): Made `company` field optional (`required: false, default: null`)
- **Activity Model** (`models/activity.js`): Made `company` field optional (`required: false, default: null`)

#### 2. Service Layer Updates
- **Activity Service** (`services/activity.js`): 
  - Updated all activity logging methods to handle `null` company values
  - Modified `getTaskActivities()` to support super admin access (can view all activities regardless of company)
  - Added user role parameter to properly handle access control

- **Task Service** (`services/task.js`):
  - Updated `getTasks()`, `getTaskById()`, and `updateTask()` methods to accept user role parameter
  - Super admin users can access tasks from all companies
  - Regular users still have company-scoped access

#### 3. Route Updates
- **Task Routes** (`routes/task.js`): Updated all route handlers to pass `req.user.role` to service methods

#### 4. Frontend Updates
- **Admin Tasks UI** (`public/js/admin_parts/admin-tasks.js`): Already had proper activity reloading after task updates

### Testing Results

A comprehensive test was performed that verified:

✅ **Task Creation**: Super admin can create tasks with `company: null`  
✅ **Activity Logging**: All task activities (creation, status changes, priority changes) are logged correctly  
✅ **Activity Retrieval**: Super admin can view all activities regardless of company  
✅ **Status Updates**: Task status changes via dropdown trigger activity logging  
✅ **Task Updates**: Task updates via modal trigger activity logging  
✅ **Company Scoping**: Regular users still only see company-scoped activities  

### Database Schema Changes

```javascript
// Updated Task Schema
{
  company: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Company',
    required: false, // Changed from true
    default: null
  }
}

// Updated Activity Schema  
{
  company: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Company',
    required: false, // Changed from true
    default: null
  }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing company-scoped tasks and activities continue to work unchanged
2. **Security**: Super admin access is controlled by role checking, not company bypass
3. **Data Integrity**: Activities are still properly associated with tasks, just with optional company scoping
4. **Performance**: No additional queries required; existing indexes remain effective

## Conclusion

The activity tracking implementation now provides comprehensive visibility into task-related activities while maintaining strict company-based isolation for regular users and full access for super admin users. The system handles both multi-tenant scenarios (with company scoping) and super admin scenarios (without company requirements) seamlessly.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Company-scoped activity tracking for regular users
- ✅ Global activity access for super admin users  
- ✅ Real-time activity updates in the UI
- ✅ Comprehensive activity logging for all task operations
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Robust error handling and logging

The implementation successfully resolves the original issue where super admin users could not see activity updates when changing task details, while maintaining the security and multi-tenancy features for regular users.
