# Integration Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the chatbot application. Integration tests verify that different components of the application work together correctly and that the application functions as expected from end to end.

## Test Environments

We will maintain three separate testing environments:

1. **Development** - For local testing during development
2. **Staging** - For pre-production testing
3. **Production** - For monitoring and validation in the production environment

## Test Categories

Our integration tests are divided into the following categories:

### API Integration Tests

These tests verify that our API endpoints work correctly with the underlying services and databases.

- **Authentication Flow** - Test login, registration, and token validation
- **Chat API** - Test message sending, receiving, and conversation management
- **File Upload/Download** - Test file upload and retrieval functionality
- **Admin API** - Test operator dashboard functionality

### Service Integration Tests

These tests verify that our services work together correctly.

- **AI Service + Conversation Service** - Test that conversations are correctly processed and AI responses are generated
- **Encryption Service + WebSockets** - Test that encryption works properly in WebSocket communication
- **Data Retention + Conversation Service** - Test that data retention policies are correctly applied to conversations

### Database Integration Tests

These tests verify that our application correctly interacts with the database.

- **Schema Validation** - Test that data models validate input correctly
- **CRUD Operations** - Test create, read, update, and delete operations
- **Indexes** - Test that queries use indexes correctly for performance

### External Service Integration Tests

These tests verify that our application correctly integrates with external services.

- **OpenAI API** - Test integration with the ChatGPT API
- **Document Storage** - Test integration with document storage services
- **Email Service** - Test integration with email notification services

## Test Implementation

### Tools and Libraries

- **Jest** - Primary testing framework
- **Supertest** - For HTTP assertions
- **MongoDB Memory Server** - For database testing
- **Socket.IO Client** - For WebSocket testing
- **Mock Service Worker** - For mocking external API calls

### Directory Structure

Integration tests are organized as follows:

```
tests/
  integration/
    api/
      auth.test.js
      chat.test.js
      files.test.js
      admin.test.js
    services/
      ai.test.js
      encryption.test.js
      dataRetention.test.js
    database/
      conversation.test.js
      user.test.js
    external/
      openai.test.js
      storage.test.js
      email.test.js
```

### Test Data Management

- **Test Fixtures** - Predefined test data for consistent testing
- **Database Seeding** - Scripts to populate test databases with realistic data
- **Cleanup** - Automatic cleanup after tests to ensure isolation

## Test Execution

### Local Development

Developers should run integration tests locally before pushing code:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Continuous Integration

Integration tests are automatically run on our CI pipeline:

1. On pull requests to main branches
2. On scheduled nightly builds
3. Before deployment to staging or production

### Test Reports

Test results are reported in the following formats:

- **Console Output** - For local development
- **JUnit XML** - For CI integration
- **HTML Reports** - For human-readable reports
- **Coverage Reports** - For code coverage analysis

## Test Maintenance

- **Regular Review** - Tests are reviewed quarterly to ensure they remain relevant
- **Failure Analysis** - Failed tests are analyzed promptly to determine root causes
- **Documentation** - Test cases are documented to explain their purpose and expected outcomes

## Conclusion

This integration testing strategy ensures that all components of our chatbot application work together correctly and that the application meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
