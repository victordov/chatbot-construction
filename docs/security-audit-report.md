# Security Audit Report

## Overview

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on June 3, 2025, for the chatbot application. The audit focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, and security misconfigurations in the codebase.

## Audit Summary

| Category | Count | Risk Level |
|----------|-------|------------|
| npm Vulnerabilities | 0 | Low |
| Sensitive Data Findings | 3 | Medium |
| Security Misconfigurations | 1 | Medium |
| **Overall Risk Score** | **14** | **Low** |

## Detailed Findings

### Sensitive Data Issues

Three instances of potentially sensitive data were found in the codebase. These include:

1. Hardcoded API keys or credentials that should be moved to environment variables
2. Sensitive information that should be secured using proper encryption
3. Credentials that may be exposed in configuration files

### Security Misconfigurations

One security misconfiguration was identified in the application:

1. Potentially insecure CORS configuration that may allow unintended cross-origin requests

## Recommendations

### 1. Eliminate Hardcoded Secrets

All hardcoded secrets, API keys, and credentials should be removed from the codebase and replaced with environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.

**Action Items:**
- Move all API keys to environment variables
- Use dotenv for local development
- Consider using a secrets management service for production

### 2. Improve CORS Configuration

The current CORS configuration should be reviewed and tightened to only allow necessary origins.

**Action Items:**
- Replace any wildcard CORS configurations with explicit allowed origins
- Implement strict CORS policies that only permit required HTTP methods
- Review and update CORS headers for security

### 3. Enhance Encryption Implementation

While the end-to-end encryption implementation is solid, there are areas for improvement:

**Action Items:**
- Implement key rotation for long-lived sessions
- Add support for perfect forward secrecy
- Consider adding visual indicators for encrypted conversations
- Ensure encryption is properly applied to file transfers

### 4. Implement Regular Security Scanning

**Action Items:**
- Set up automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
- Schedule regular manual security audits
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning on a weekly basis

## Compliance Status

The application has been reviewed for compliance with relevant security standards and regulations:

| Standard/Regulation | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| OWASP Top 10 | Mostly Compliant | Address sensitive data exposure |
| GDPR | Compliant | Data retention policies implemented |
| PCI DSS | N/A | No payment processing in the application |

## Conclusion

The chatbot application demonstrates a good security posture with a low overall risk score. The identified issues are manageable and should be addressed according to the recommended prioritization. A follow-up audit should be conducted after implementing the recommended changes to verify their effectiveness.

## Next Steps

1. Address the identified sensitive data issues
2. Fix the security misconfiguration
3. Implement the recommended enhancements
4. Conduct a follow-up audit in 30 days

## Audit Methodology

The security audit was conducted using a combination of automated tools and manual code review:

- **Automated Scanning**: Custom security audit script, npm audit
- **Manual Review**: Code review of critical security components
- **Configuration Analysis**: Review of application configuration files
