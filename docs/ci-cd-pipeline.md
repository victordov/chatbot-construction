# Continuous Integration and Deployment

This document outlines the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the chatbot application.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment of the application to ensure consistent and reliable releases. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of several stages that run when code is pushed to the repository or pull requests are created.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Lint Check

The linting stage checks the code for style and potential errors using ESLint.

- **Trigger**: On every push and pull request
- **Configuration**: `.eslintrc.js`
- **Output**: Pass/fail status, with error details on failure

### 2. Testing

The testing stage runs all unit and integration tests to ensure the code functions correctly.

- **Trigger**: On every push and pull request
- **Environment**: Node.js with MongoDB service
- **Test Commands**:
  - `npm test` (runs all tests)
  - `npm run test:unit` (runs only unit tests)
  - `npm run test:integration` (runs only integration tests)
- **Output**: Test results and coverage reports

### 3. Security Scan

The security scan stage checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and potential security issues in the code.

- **Trigger**: On every push and pull request
- **Tools**:
  - npm audit
  - OWASP Dependency-Check
- **Output**: Security reports with details of any vulnerabilities found

### 4. Build

The build stage creates a distributable package of the application.

- **Trigger**: On push to main or development branches
- **Steps**:
  - Install dependencies
  - Create environment files
  - Build static assets
  - Package the application
- **Output**: Packaged application artifact

### 5. Deployment

The deployment stage deploys the application to the appropriate environment.

- **Staging Deployment**:
  - **Trigger**: On push to development branch
  - **Environment**: Staging server
  - **Steps**: Transfer build, install dependencies, restart application
  
- **Production Deployment**:
  - **Trigger**: On push to main branch
  - **Environment**: Production server
  - **Steps**: Transfer build, install dependencies, restart application

## Environment Configuration

The pipeline uses environment secrets to securely handle sensitive information:

- **MONGODB_URI**: Database connection string
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for JWT authentication
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: API key for OpenAI services
- **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**: SSH key for server access
- **SSH_USER**: Username for SSH access
- **SSH_HOST**: Hostname for SSH access

## Pipeline Status

The status of the CI/CD pipeline can be monitored on the GitHub Actions tab of the repository. Each workflow run shows detailed information about the success or failure of each stage.

## Manual Deployment

In addition to the automated pipeline, manual deployment can be triggered through the GitHub Actions interface by running the workflow manually.

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment causes issues, the following rollback procedure should be followed:

1. Identify the last stable version in the GitHub repository
2. Manually trigger the deployment workflow for that version
3. Monitor the application to ensure normal operation

## Maintenance

The CI/CD pipeline should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains effective and efficient. This includes:

- Updating dependencies used in the workflow
- Reviewing and optimizing test coverage
- Enhancing security scanning procedures
- Improving deployment processes
