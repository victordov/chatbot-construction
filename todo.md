### **Task Creation and Follow-up Scheduling (Admin Operators Only)**

This section outlines the requirements for implementing task creation and follow-up scheduling features, which are exclusively available to **admin operators**. Regular users cannot create, view, or manage tasks and follow-ups.

### **1. Task Creation from Chat**

#### **Functionality Requirements**

* **Task Creation**: An **admin operator** can create a task directly from the chat interface. A modal will provide fields for a title, description, due date, priority, and assignee (another admin operator).
* **User Contact Information**: The task creation modal will display the user's name, phone number, and email if available, with clear indicators for any missing information.
* **Task Visibility and Access**: Tasks are assigned to specific admin operators. All admin operators can view and filter tasks on a centralized dashboard.
* **Task Management**: Admin operators can update task statuses (e.g., Open, In Progress, Completed) and add comments for collaboration.
* **Integration with Chat**: All tasks will include a link back to the original chat conversation for context.

#### **Detailed Task Breakdown**

* **Database and Models**
  * [ ] **TASK-001**: Create a `Task` model in MongoDB.
  * [ ] **TASK-002**: Establish a relationship between the `Task` and `Conversation` models.
  * [ ] **TASK-003**: Index the database for efficient task queries.
* **API Development**
  * [ ] **TASK-005**: Develop API endpoints for task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  * [ ] **TASK-006**: Implement an API for assigning tasks to admin operators.
  * [ ] **TASK-007**: Create an API for filtering and searching tasks.
* **UI Components**
  * [ ] **TASK-010**: Design a "Create Task" button for the admin operator's chat interface.
  * [ ] **TASK-011**: Develop the task creation modal.
  * [ ] **TASK-012**: Implement UI indicators for missing user contact information.
  * [ ] **TASK-014**: Create a task list view with filtering options for admin operators.
* **Notification System**
  * [ ] **TASK-017**: Build a notification system for new task assignments to admin operators.
  * [ ] **TASK-018**: Implement reminders for approaching due dates.

### **2. Follow-up Scheduling (Admin Operators Only)**

#### **Functionality Requirements**

* **Follow-up Creation**: An **admin operator** can schedule a follow-up from the chat interface. The scheduling modal will include fields for the date/time, follow-up type, notes, assignee, and communication channel.
* **User Contact Information**: The follow-up scheduling modal will display the user's contact information and show alerts if the required information for the selected channel (e.g., email address for an email follow-up) is missing.
* **Follow-up Management**: Admin operators can view all scheduled follow-ups in a calendar or list format and update their status (e.g., Scheduled, Completed, Missed).
* **Visibility**: All admin operators can view follow-ups scheduled by their colleagues.

#### **Detailed Task Breakdown**

* **Database and Models**
  * [ ] **TASK-021**: Create a `Followup` model in MongoDB.
  * [ ] **TASK-022**: Link the `Followup` model to the `Conversation` model.
  * [ ] **TASK-023**: Add support for creating follow-ups to existing follow-ups (nested follow-ups).
* **API Development**
  * [ ] **TASK-025**: Develop API endpoints for follow-up management.
  * [ ] **TASK-026**: Implement a follow-up scheduling API.
* **UI Components**
  * [ ] **TASK-030**: Design a "Schedule Follow-up" button for the admin operator's chat view.
  * [ ] **TASK-031**: Develop the follow-up scheduling modal.
  * [ ] **TASK-032**: Create UI alerts for missing contact information.
  * [ ] **TASK-034**: Implement a calendar view for scheduled follow-ups for admin operators.
* **Automation Features**
  * [ ] **TASK-038**: Implement a reminder system for admin operators about upcoming follow-ups.
  * [ ] **TASK-039**: Develop options for the automatic assignment of follow-ups to admin operators.

### **3. Integration and General Concerns**

* **UI Updates**:
  * [ ] **TASK-042**: Integrate task and follow-up management functionalities into the main admin dashboard.
* **Security and Privacy**:
  * [ ] **TASK-051**: Ensure all task and follow-up data complies with existing data retention policies.
  * [ ] **TASK-053**: Implement robust access controls for viewing user contact information within tasks and follow-ups.
* **Analytics and Reporting**:
  * [ ] **TASK-055**: Implement analytics to track task completion rates by admin operators.
